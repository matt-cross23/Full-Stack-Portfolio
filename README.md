# Full-Stack-Portfolio

## I'm trying to figure out why github pages is deploying this readme despite the express server using a get request to sendFile that should join the index.html in the public folder. 

### For the time being, the index.html is also located in the root directory, so I can show you my work! 

*Sorry for the inconvenience and I hope to fix this bug ASAP*
